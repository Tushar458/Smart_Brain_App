[Smart Brain](https://tushar458.github.io/Smart_Brain/) is a web app that uses the Clarifai API to locate a face in a picture. This face-recognition app uses the following technologies:

- [MERN stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack): Express JS, React JS, and Node JS
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): for back-end server - code posted here: [Smart-Brain-Api](https://tushar458.github.io/Smart_Brain/)
- [PostresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): for database
- [Render](https://render.com/): server and database hosting
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework for the styles
- [React-Parallax-Tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt): for tilting animation on logo
- [Particles-BG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particles-bg): For background animation
- [Bycrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt): To encrypt passwords
